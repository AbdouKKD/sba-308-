What This Code Does

    Learning About a Class:
        There’s a class called "Introduction to JavaScript."
        It has some homework tasks that students need to do.

    What Students Did:
        Each student tried their homework and wrote down what they got.

    Checking Homework:
        The code looks at what each student did and sees if they did it on time.
        If they were late, it takes away a little bit of their points.

    Finding Averages:
        The code adds up all the points for each student and figures out their average score.
        Then it says if they did a great job, a good job, or if they need to try harder.

    Error Checking:
        If something goes wrong, like if the class ID doesn’t match, it tells us with a message.
